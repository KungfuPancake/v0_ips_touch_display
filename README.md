# A better Voron V0 KlipperScreen Display
*Warning:* This is (currently) not a straightforward mod. You will need to:
* have PCBs made and solder SMD components including a 40 pin connector with a 0.5mm pin pitch
* build a wiring harness
* build a custom Linux kernel or a complete OS image
* apply a DTS overlay to make the kernel aware of the display

Once Linux 6.11 has been adopted by Raspberry Pi OS/Armbian a big chunk of that work will go away.

## Instructions
### Hardware
Despite claiming to follow the Raspberry Pi GPIO header scheme, most non-RPI SBCs have some differences on the pinout and the peripherals.
If your SBC is not listed here, try to find some documentation or schematics for your board. You will need:
* 1x SPI with one CS/CE line
* 1x IÂ²C
* 1x GPIO with IRQ capability
* 4x GPIO outputs, optionally with one PWM capable pin

### Raspberry Pi OS

### Armbian
Armbian has an easy to set up build environment based on Docker. All operations can be done via a provided shell script.

`git clone https://github.com/armbian/build armbian`

Depending on the target board you may have to change some Kernel options before building. These settings are required:
```
TOUCHSCREEN_EDT_FT5X06=m
BACKLIGHT_GPIO=m
BACKLIGHT_PWM=m
```
Then build the image. Replace the BOARD value with your SBC, e.g. `orangepipc` if you have an Orange Pi PC.
```
./compile.sh BOARD=<your sbc> BRANCH=edge kernel-config
./compile.sh BOARD=<your sbc> BRANCH=edge BUILD_DESKTOP=no BUILD_MINIMAL=yes KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no RELEASE=bookworm
```

### Instructions for tested SBCs
#### Orange Pi PC
Build the image:
```
./compile.sh BOARD=orangepipc BRANCH=edge kernel-config
./compile.sh BOARD=orangepipc BRANCH=edge BUILD_DESKTOP=no BUILD_MINIMAL=yes KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no RELEASE=bookworm
```

```
git clone https://github.com/KungfuPancake/v0_ips_touch_display.git
git clone https://github.com/notro/panel-mipi-dbi.git
cd v0_ips_touch_display/
armbian-add-overlay sun8i-h3-v0disp.dts
../mipi-dbi-cmd/mipi-dbi-cmd /lib/firmware/panel-mipi-dbi-spi.bin panel-mipi-dbi-spi.txt
reboot
```

* Orange Pi Zero 3

* Bigtreetech Pi V1.2
Build the image:
```
./compile.sh BOARD=bigtreetech-cb1 BRANCH=edge kernel-config
./compile.sh BOARD=bigtreetech-cb1 BRANCH=edge BUILD_DESKTOP=no BUILD_MINIMAL=yes KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no RELEASE=bookworm
```
